====
Create and train a Naive Bayes classifier in naive_bayes/nb_author_id.py. Use it to make predictions for the test set. What is the accuracy?

When training you may see the following error: UserWarning: Duplicate scores. Result may depend on feature ordering.There are probably duplicate features, or you used a classification score for a regression task. warn("Duplicate scores. Result may depend on feature ordering.")

This is a warning that two or more words happen to have the same usage patterns in the emails--as far as the algorithm is concerned, this means that two features are the same. Some algorithms will actually break (mathematically wonâ€™t work) or give multiple different answers (depending on feature ordering) when there are duplicate features and sklearn is giving us a warning. Good information, but not something we have to worry about.
