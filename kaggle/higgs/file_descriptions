File descriptions
=================
> training.csv - Training set of 250000 events, with an ID column, 30 feature columns, a weight column and a label column.
> test.csv - Test set of 550000 events with an ID column and 30 feature columns.
> random_submission - Sample submission file in the correct format. File format is described on the Evaluation page.
> HiggsBosonCompetition_AMSMetric - Python script to calculate the competition evaluation metric.

- For detailed information on the semantics of the features, labels, and weights, see the technical documentation from the LAL website on the task.

Some details to get started:
============================
> all variables are floating point, except PRI_jet_num which is integer
> variables prefixed with PRI (for PRImitives) are "raw" quantities about the bunch collision as measured by the detector.
> variables prefixed with DER (for DERived) are quantities computed from the primitive features, which were selected by  the physicists of ATLAS
> it can happen that for some entries some variables are meaningless or cannot be computed; in this case, their value is -999.0, which is outside the normal range of all variables
